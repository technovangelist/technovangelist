My name is **Matt** and I was a founding member of the maintainer team at [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (after we pivoted from making RBAC tools for K8s and SSH key management tools). 
I left there in January 2024 to go fulltime on my YouTube channel, [Technovangelist](https://YouTube.com/technovangelist)

Before that, I was the first Evangelist at a tiny startup called [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com) (well, it was only 30 people when I started there).

If you see any videos, talks, blog posts, streams and more about InfraHQ, there is a good chance I had a hand in it.
